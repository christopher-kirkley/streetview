pre-flight request

if it's not your api, you can't do anything

they don't want API request without permission
OR
they don't want it in the front end
(someone can go in your code and find the key)
- or go into network, and find the api key
- maybe MitM attack

'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header - if the script in the browser can call an API
Remember that CORS IS A BROWSER POLICY
this is why you can do this on the 'backend' - anywhere where code is not running in the browser

create a proxy
fetch(proxy + url)
